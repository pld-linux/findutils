-@node Fast Full Name Search
-@subsection Fast Full Name Search
-
-To search for files by name without having to actually scan the
-directories on the disk (which can be slow), you can use the
-@code{locate} program.  For each shell pattern you give it,
-@code{locate} searches one or more databases of file names and
-displays the file names that contain the pattern.  @xref{Shell Pattern
-Matching}, for details about shell patterns.
-
-If a pattern is a plain string -- it contains no
-metacharacters -- @code{locate} displays all file names in the database
-that contain that string.  If a pattern contains
-metacharacters, @code{locate} only displays file names that match the
-pattern exactly.  As a result, patterns that contain metacharacters
-should usually begin with a @samp{*}, and will most often end with one
-as well.  The exceptions are patterns that are intended to explicitly
-match the beginning or end of a file name.
-
-If you only want @code{locate} to match against the last component of
-the file names (the ``base name'' of the files) you can use the
-@samp{--basename} option.  The opposite behaviour is the default, but
-can be selected explicitly by using the option @samp{--wholename}.
-
-The command
-@example
-locate @var{pattern}
-@end example
-
-is almost equivalent to
-@example
-find @var{directories} -name @var{pattern}
-@end example
-
-where @var{directories} are the directories for which the file name
-databases contain information.  The differences are that the
-@code{locate} information might be out of date, and that @code{locate}
-handles wildcards in the pattern slightly differently than @code{find}
-(@pxref{Shell Pattern Matching}).
-
-The file name databases contain lists of files that were on the system
-when the databases were last updated.  The system administrator can
-choose the file name of the default database, the frequency with which
-the databases are updated, and the directories for which they contain
-entries.
-

-@node LOCATE02 Database Format
-@subsection LOCATE02 Database Format
-
-@code{updatedb} runs a program called @code{frcode} to
-@dfn{front-compress} the list of file names, which reduces the
-database size by a factor of 4 to 5.  Front-compression (also known as
-incremental encoding) works as follows.
-
-The database entries are a sorted list (case-insensitively, for users'
-convenience).  Since the list is sorted, each entry is likely to share
-a prefix (initial string) with the previous entry.  Each database
-entry begins with an offset-differential count byte, which is the
-additional number of characters of prefix of the preceding entry to
-use beyond the number that the preceding entry is using of its
-predecessor.  (The counts can be negative.)  Following the count is a
-null-terminated ASCII remainder -- the part of the name that follows
-the shared prefix.
-
-If the offset-differential count is larger than can be stored in a
-byte (+/-127), the byte has the value 0x80 and the count follows in a
-2-byte word, with the high byte first (network byte order).
-
-Every database begins with a dummy entry for a file called
-@file{LOCATE02}, which @code{locate} checks for to ensure that the
-database file has the correct format; it ignores the entry in doing
-the search.
-
-Databases cannot be concatenated together, even if the first (dummy)
-entry is trimmed from all but the first database.  This is because the
-offset-differential count in the first entry of the second and
-following databases will be wrong.
-
-In the output of @samp{locate --statistics}, the new database format
-is referred to as @samp{LOCATE02}.
-

-@node slocate Database Format
-@subsection slocate Database Format
-
-The @code{slocate} program uses a database format similar to, but not
-quite the same as, GNU @code{locate}.  The first byte of the database
-specifies its @dfn{security level}.  If the security level is 0,
-@code{slocate} will read, match and print filenames on the basis of
-the information in the database only.  However, if the security level
-byte is 1, @code{slocate} omits entries from its output if the
-invoking user is unable to access them.  The second byte of the
-database is zero.  The second byte is immediately followed by the
-first database entry.  The first entry in the database is not preceded
-by any differential count or dummy entry.  Instead the differential
-count for the first item is assumed to be zero.
-
-Starting with the second entry (if any) in the database, data is
-interpreted as for the GNU LOCATE02 format.
-
-@node Old Database Format
-@subsection Old Database Format
-
-The old database format is used by Unix @code{locate} and @code{find}
-programs and pre-4.0 releases of GNU findutils.  @code{locate}
-understands this format, though @code{updatedb} will no longer produce
-it.
-
-The old format differs from @samp{LOCATE02} in the following ways.
-Instead of each entry starting with an offset-differential count byte
-and ending with a null, byte values from 0 through 28 indicate
-offset-differential counts from -14 through 14.  The byte value
-indicating that a long offset-differential count follows is 0x1e (30),
-not 0x80.  The long counts are stored in host byte order, which is not
-necessarily network byte order, and host integer word size, which is
-usually 4 bytes.  They also represent a count 14 less than their
-value.  The database lines have no termination byte; the start of the
-next line is indicated by its first byte having a value <= 30.
-
-In addition, instead of starting with a dummy entry, the old database
-format starts with a 256 byte table containing the 128 most common
-bigrams in the file list.  A bigram is a pair of adjacent bytes.
-Bytes in the database that have the high bit set are indexes (with the
-high bit cleared) into the bigram table.  The bigram and
-offset-differential count coding makes these databases 20-25% smaller
-than the new format, but makes them not 8-bit clean.  Any byte in a
-file name that is in the ranges used for the special codes is replaced
-in the database by a question mark, which not coincidentally is the
-shell wildcard to match a single character. The old format therefore
-cannot faithfully store entries with non-ASCII characters.
-
-Because the long counts are stored as
-native-order machine words, the database format is not easily used in
-environments which differ in terms of byte order.  If locate databases
-are to be shared between machines, the @samp{LOCATE02} database format should
-be used.  This has other benefits as discussed above.  However, the
-length of the filename currently being processed can normally be used
-to place reasonable limits on the long counts and so this information
-is used by locate to help it guess the byte ordering of the old format
-database.  Unless it finds evidence to the contrary, @code{locate}
-will assume that the byte order of the database is the same as the
-native byte order of the machine running @code{locate}.  The output of
-@samp{locate --statistics} also includes information about the byte
-order of old-format databases.
-
-The output of @samp{locate --statistics} will give an incorrect count
-of the number of file names containing newlines or high-bit characters
-for old-format databases.
-
-Old versions of GNU @code{locate} fail to correctly handle very long
-file names, possibly leading to security problems relating to a heap
-buffer overrun.  @xref{Security Considerations for locate}, for a
-detailed explanation.
-
-@node Newline Handling
-@section Newline Handling
-
-Within the database, file names are terminated with a null character.
-This is the case for both the old and the new format.
-
-When the new database format is being used, the compression technique
-used to generate the database though relies on the ability to sort the
-list of files before they are presented to @code{frcode}.
-
-If the system's sort command allows its input list of files to be
-separated with null characters via the @samp{-z} option, this option
-is used and therefore @code{updatedb} and @code{locate} will both
-correctly handle file names containing newlines.  If the @code{sort}
-command lacks support for this, the list of files is delimited with
-the newline character, meaning that parts of file names containing
-newlines will be incorrectly sorted.  This can result in both
-incorrect matches and incorrect failures to match.

-The environment variable @code{NETPATHS} also sets this value.
-Default is none.
-
-@item --prunepaths='@var{path}@dots{}'
-Directories to omit from the database, which would otherwise be
-included.  The environment variable @code{PRUNEPATHS} also sets this
-value.  Default is @file{/tmp /usr/tmp /var/tmp /afs}.  The paths are
-used as regular expressions (with @code{find ... -regex}, so you need
-to specify these paths in the same way that @code{find} will encounter
-them.  This means for example that the paths must not include trailing
-slashes.
-
-@item --prunefs='@var{path}@dots{}'
-Filesystems to omit from the database, which would otherwise be
-included.  Note that files are pruned when a filesystem is reached;
-Any filesystem mounted under an undesired filesystem will be ignored.
-The environment variable @code{PRUNEFS} also sets this value.  Default
-is @file{nfs NFS proc}.
-
-@item --output=@var{dbfile}
-The database file to build.  The default is system-dependent, but
-when this document was formatted it was @file{@value{LOCATE_DB}}.
-
-@item --localuser=@var{user}
-The user to search the non-network directories as, using @code{su}.
-Default is to search the non-network directories as the current user.
-You can also use the environment variable @code{LOCALUSER} to set this user.
-
-@item --netuser=@var{user}
-The user to search network directories as, using @code{su}.  Default
-@code{user} is @code{daemon}.  You can also use the environment variable
-@code{NETUSER} to set this user.
-
-@item --dbformat=@var{FORMAT}
-Generate the locate database in format @code{FORMAT}.  Supported
-database formats include @code{LOCATE02} (which is the default) and
-@code{slocate}.  The @code{slocate} format exists for compatibility
-with @code{slocate}. @xref{Database Formats}, for a detailed
-description of each format.

-@item warning: database @file{@value{LOCATE_DB}} is more than 8 days old
-The @code{locate} program relies on a database which is periodically
-built by the @code{updatedb} program.  That hasn't happened in a long
-time.  To fix this problem, run @code{updatedb} manually.  This can
-often happen on systems that are generally not left on, so the
-periodic ``cron'' task which normally does this doesn't get a chance
-to run.
-
-@item locate database @file{@value{LOCATE_DB}} is corrupt or invalid
-This should not happen.  Re-run @code{updatedb}.  If that works, but
-@code{locate} still produces this error, run @code{locate --version}
-and @code{updatedb --version}.  These should produce the same output.
-If not, you are using a mixed toolset; check your @samp{$PATH}
-environment variable and your shell aliases (if you have any).  If
-both programs claim to be GNU versions, this is a bug; all versions of
-these programs should interoperate without problem.  Ask for help on
